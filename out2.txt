lf there 's something rn [his world that can never be taken away
from a person, l bel ve that it is education. Having born with a
special intelectual abiity, l never thought of rt as an opportunity
to stand out intently, but instead, l used this ability to help out
others. At elementary school, l started tutoring my dassmates
one at a time about difﬁcult sub]ecls. At hi h school, l helped out
teachers in tutor dases prior to examination days. lt was in
those times that l found the fulﬁlling serse of living rather than
those timesl got medals.

 

l took up Secondary Education ma]oriltg in Mathematits in my
college years. People often have this sense of fear when hearing
the word math, and as a future teacher, l would like to change
that. l dream of changing people's fears into love. teach them to
transform those fears into positive perspective because fear is
what fais them to do something before they even try it. l don't
want to simply be a teacher. l want to be an inspiration.

After having graduated, t went to school again to earn my degree
as Masters in Education. However, t know for myself that there is
some g more that l want to achieve. Not only for my own
satsfacuon, but becauset know that the moret know, the moret
do not know. The more thatt experience, the moret can share to
my future students. Vlnth this, l am determined to earn my PhD
degree, the highest and most acmmplshed level in the academia,
' l know that taking on this
and hone me to the best of my
capabrr res as an educator. And t know of no better place to help
me in my goals than your instit n, which s why t hope that
you would give me a slot as one ofyour students.
